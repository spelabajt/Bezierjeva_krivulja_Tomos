  <h1>Tomos logo design using multiple graphic techniques</h1>
</div>

As part of the project assignment, one of the requirements was to create a logo using three different graphic approaches in order to demonstrate the differences between various computer graphics techniques. The first version of the logo was created as an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image, which allows unlimited scaling without loss of quality and is suitable for use in both digital and printed media. The second version was created as a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image, which is composed of individual pixels and is primarily intended for display on screens.

The third version of the logo was created using Bézier curves, which are based on mathematical functions and enable precise drawing of complex shapes and smooth transitions. This method requires a solid understanding of control points and curve paths, while also providing a high level of accuracy and flexibility.

As the motif for the logo, I chose the Tomos logo, as it is a well-known Slovenian industrial symbol with clearly defined lines and distinctive typography, making it suitable for an effective comparison of the different design techniques. This choice enabled a better understanding of the differences between vector and raster graphics, as well as the practical use of Bézier curves in graphic design.

The created graphic files were then integrated into a website, where they were used as part of the project’s visual presentation. In this way, the project also demonstrates the practical application of different graphic formats in a web environment and their adaptability and efficiency when displayed on various devices and screen resolutions.
