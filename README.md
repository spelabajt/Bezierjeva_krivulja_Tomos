  <h1>Tomos logo design using multiple graphic techniques</h1>
</div>

##Project Overview
As part of the project assignment, one of the requirements was to create a logo using three different graphic approaches in order to demonstrate the differences between various computer graphics techniques. The goal was to compare vector-based and raster-based graphics and to understand their practical use in digital environments.



##SVG and PNG Logo Versions
The first version of the logo was created as an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image, which allows unlimited scaling without loss of quality and is suitable for use in both digital and printed media. The second version was created as a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image, which is composed of individual pixels and is primarily intended for display on screens.

##Logo Created with Bézier Curves
The third version of the logo was created using Bézier curves, which are based on mathematical functions and enable precise drawing of complex shapes and smooth transitions. This approach requires a solid understanding of control points and curve paths, while also offering a high level of accuracy and flexibility in graphic design.

##Choice of Logo Motif
As the motif for the logo, I chose the Tomos logo, as it is a well-known Slovenian industrial symbol with clearly defined lines and distinctive typography. This made it suitable for an effective comparison of the different graphic design techniques and helped to highlight the differences between vector and raster graphics.

##Integration into a Website
The completed graphic files were then integrated into a website, where they were used as part of the project’s visual presentation. This step demonstrated the practical application of different graphic formats in a web environment, as well as their adaptability and efficiency when displayed on various devices and screen resolutions.
